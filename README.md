# csharp-progressbar

"Can't use the computer right now, it's processing..." -- C# learning project.


## Why?

When I first started to learn Visual Basic in school back in early 2000, I created a joke application that would start a progress bar that would spin indefinitely.

This was mainly a way to slack away and fool around with other _"more interesting things"_ back then. I really don't remember what those _"more interesting things"_ were, but that's besides the point.

Later I saw a xkcd comic that explained the idea.

## Really, but why?

I'm trying to learn C# now, so this was kinda the first thing I remembered and thought it would be cool to recreate the app.

Not a great reason, but a honest one.
